TASK-04: 
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

Solution:
Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to remove any irrelevant information, such as special characters, emojis, or URLs, and to normalize the text.

Data Analysis: The cleaned data was analyzed using the TextBlob library in Python to perform sentiment analysis. TextBlob provides a simple API for sentiment analysis, giving a polarity score indicating the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the text.

Export to Excel: The analyzed data was then exported to an Excel file for further processing and visualization in Power BI.

Visualization in Power BI: The Excel file containing the analyzed data was imported into Power BI for visualization. Visualizations, such as bar plots or pie charts, were created to illustrate the sentiment patterns in the data.
